## Ngopract Iteration
Ngopract iteration consists of several branches (01-, 02-, etc) to ensure the best "ngopract" experience.

- [01-Simple GraphQL](https://github.com/adhywiranata/graphqlibrarian/tree/01-basic-graphql-usage), simple getting started with query and mutation on an in-memory global variable fake database
- [02-More Structured GraphQL](), deeper example, still using in-memory fake database
