## Ngopract Iteration
Ngopract iteration consists of several branches (01-, 02-, etc) to ensure the best "ngopract" experience.

- [01-Simple GraphQL](https://github.com/adhywiranata/graphqlibrarian/tree/01-basic-graphql-usage), simple getting started with query and mutation on an in-memory global variable fake database
- [02-Simple GraphQL with Async](https://github.com/adhywiranata/graphqlibrarian/tree/02-deeper-graphql), deeper example in async operation, still using in-memory fake database
- [03-Simple GraphQL without Schema Builder String](https://github.com/adhywiranata/graphqlibrarian/tree/03-graphql-without-schema-builder), continuation of step 02, without a schema builder, but using objects.
- [04-More GraphQL Implementations](https://github.com/adhywiranata/graphqlibrarian/tree/04-more-graphql-implementations)
